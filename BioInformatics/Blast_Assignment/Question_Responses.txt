a. Are the sequences all roughly the same length?

Yes all the sequences are roughly the same length.

b. What do the asterisks and colons represent?

They represent alignment patterns as we spoke of in class. Spaces between that have been added in order to properly align.

c. Is there a pattern to the conserved regions (are the conserved amino acids randomly located, or clustered into strings of conserved regions)

They are located into strings of conserved regions which indicates a pattern of conservation of these regions. 

d. Does the level of  “conservation” indicated by the alignment suggest that these sequences represent  homologous genes? 

I would think that it does indicate that they represent homologous genes.
